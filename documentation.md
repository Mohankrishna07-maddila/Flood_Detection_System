Smart Water Level Monitoring System


1. What It's All About
Water is one of our most important resources, but managing it can be a challenge. Sometimes there's not enough, and other times there's too much. Traditionally, people have had to check water levels in tanks, rivers, or reservoirs by hand, which is slow and can lead to mistakes.
This project is a simple solution. We're using a camera to automatically watch the water level. The system "sees" the water with a special kind of software (called Computer Vision). Based on what it sees, it sends a color-coded message‚Äîgreen, yellow, or red‚Äîto a person in charge, who can then quickly tell the local community or town authorities what's happening.

2. Our Main Goals
‚óè	To build a system that can watch water levels in real-time using a camera.
‚óè	To sort water levels into three clear categories: Green (Safe), Yellow (A Little Low or High), and Red (Critical).
‚óè	To send automatic alerts to a manager so they can make quick decisions.
‚óè	To create a solution that can be used in both big cities and small villages.

3. How It Works	
Here's a step-by-step look at how the system does its job:
‚óè	Camera Feed: A camera continuously records a video of the water.
‚óè	Video Cleanup: The system tidies up the video, focusing only on the important part (the water) and getting rid of any visual clutter.
‚óè	Water Level Finder: The system "looks" for the water's surface line and figures out how high it is.
‚óè	Alert Rules: It then uses simple rules to decide what the water level means:
‚óã	Green: The level is safe.
‚óã	Yellow: The level is a bit high or low, so be cautious.
‚óã	Red: The level is very low or about to overflow.
‚óè	Alert Sent: The system automatically sends an alert to the person in charge.
‚óè	Community Notified: The person in charge then tells the community or authorities if action is needed.

4. What We Used to Build It
‚óè	Language: Python
‚óè	Software Tools:
‚óã	OpenCV: The main software that lets the computer "see."
‚óã	NumPy: Helps with the math and calculations.
‚óã	Other Tools: We can use other software for things like sending emails or text messages.
‚óè	Hardware:
‚Ä¢  Fixed Camera with Reference Scale
‚Ä¢	A camera points to a graduated scale (like a ruler placed in the water).
‚Ä¢	Image processing reads the scale markings that are submerged or visible.
‚Ä¢	Simple, low-cost method

How It Measures the Water: üîπ How a Camera Sensor Measures Water
1.	Image Capture
o	The camera takes pictures or continuous video of the water surface and the surroundings.
o	A reference object (like a scale/marker) is often placed so the water level can be compared visually.
2.	Image Processing
o	The software detects the water line (the boundary between water and air or water and a marked scale).
o	By identifying this line, the system can calculate the current height of water.
3.	Estimation of Amount
o	If the tank/reservoir‚Äôs dimensions are known, the water level can be converted into volume using formulas (e.g., depth √ó area for rectangular tanks, or depth with radius for circular tanks).
4.	Alerts & Monitoring
o	The processed data can trigger alerts if the water level crosses a threshold (e.g., flood warning, low supply warning).

 How Alerts & Monitoring Work in a Camera-Based Water Level System
My project has three layers:
1.	Sensing Layer (Camera + Processing)
o	Camera captures images.
o	Software (local device or server) processes and determines water level.
o	Threshold rules are applied (e.g., if water > 80% ‚Üí high alert).
2.	Communication Layer (Sending Data)
o	Processed data/alerts are transmitted from the local system to servers or cloud platforms.
o	Technologies: Wi-Fi, GSM/4G, LoRa, or MQTT over Internet.
3.	Application Layer (User Notifications)
o	Alerts and live data are shown on mobile apps and web dashboards.
o	Users get notifications (SMS, push alerts, email).
o	Dashboard provides visual monitoring (graphs, history, live camera feed).
Sending Alerts to Mobile
1.	SMS Alerts
o	Use SMS gateways (like Twilio, AWS SNS, or local telecom API).
o	Example: ‚ÄúWarning: Water level has reached 90% at Dam X.‚Äù
2.	Push Notifications (Mobile App)
o	If you have an Android/iOS app, use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
o	Triggered whenever the backend detects threshold breach.
3.	WhatsApp / Telegram Alerts (Optional, modern approach)
o	Integration with WhatsApp Business API or Telegram bot to push instant messages.

Sending Alerts to Web Dashboard
1.	Real-Time Dashboard Updates
o	Use WebSockets or MQTT for instant updates.
o	When water level changes, the dashboard reflects it live (no refresh needed).
2.	Email Alerts for Admins
o	Automated emails when thresholds are reached.s
3.	Example: ‚ÄúALERT: Flood risk detected 
4.	Visual Indicators
o	Dashboard UI can show color-coded levels (green = safe, yellow = warning, red = danger).
o	Flashing notifications, pop-ups, or sound alarms for critical cases.
‚úÖ Example Workflow:
1.	Camera ‚Üí detects high water ‚Üí software processes ‚Üí Alert Triggered.
2.	Backend server ‚Üí pushes notification via Firebase (to mobiles).
3.	Backend also ‚Üí updates real-time MQTT/WebSocket ‚Üí web dashboard turns RED ALERT.
4.	Simultaneously ‚Üí SMS/email sent to registered users.

6. A Peek at the Code
The system uses code to make all of this happen. Here's a small sample that shows how it captures the video and figures out the water level:
Python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Capture video from camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    # ... (The code cleans up the image and finds the water level)
    water_level = (h / frame.shape[0]) * 100  # Percentage
    # ... (The code decides if it's red, yellow, or green)
    # Display the level on the screen
    cv2.putText(frame, f"Level: {int(water_level)}% - {status}", (20,40),
                cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0,0,255), 2)
    cv2.imshow("Water Level Monitor", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
This code tells the computer to continuously watch the video feed, measure the water level, and display the result on the screen.
7. What We Hope to Achieve
‚óè	A way to monitor water levels automatically and instantly.
‚óè	Fewer mistakes and faster responses compared to checking by hand.
‚óè	An early warning system to help prevent water shortages or floods.
‚óè	A flexible solution that can be used for water tanks, dams, and rivers.

8. Future Ideas
‚óè	Add more sensors to the system to double-check the water levels.
‚óè	Create a simple website where the data can be seen all in one place.
‚óè	Use smarter software that can still work well even when the lighting is poor.
‚óè	Expand the system to monitor many locations at once.

9. Final Thoughts
This project shows how a simple camera and some smart software can be used to create a low-cost, automated system for managing water. By providing timely alerts, it helps people take preventive steps and keeps communities informed, leading to better overall water management.
